# Automatic Bonus Progression

An item rebalance mod for Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous based on Pathfinder's [Automatic Bonus Progression](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/unchained-rules/automatic-bonus-progression/) ruleset. **This is not compatible with controllers.**

### This mod creates a save dependency. Once you save with this mod enabled it must remain enabled or you will lose access to the save.

### [Settings are NOT in UMM, they use Mod Menu](#mod-options) 

### Currently in BETA

Additional items planned for release:

* Weapon Enchants
    * [Lifesurge](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/Lifesurge/)
    * [Limning](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/Limning/)
    * [Ominous](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/Ominous/)
    * [Phase Locking](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/Phase-Locking/)
    * [Quaking](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/Quaking/)
    * [Sneaky](https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/Sneaky/)

## Problems or Suggestions

File a [bug](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D) or [feature request](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/issues/new?template=feature_request.md&title=%5BFeature%5D). You can also reach me (@WittleWolfie) on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/owlcat) in the #mod-user-general channel.

## Installation

Download [AutomaticBonusProgression.zip](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/releases/latest) and install it using ModFinder or Unity Mod Manager. Make sure to install [TabletopTweaks-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core) and [ModMenu](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/ModMenu) as well.

### If you use this on an existing save, you'll need to respec both regular and mythic paths to get full functionality.

### This doesn't work with controllers. You have to use mouse and keyboard.

## How it works

Automatic Bonus Progression automatically grants stat bonuses usually provided by items which no longer provide them. As a result you are free to equip items based on their special abilities and effects.

*Note: Items in game still list these bonuses in the UI, but they do not apply. I will likely never address this, as it is a huge effort to fix.*

* **Armor Attunement**: *+X Enhancement to Armor*
    * +1 Chainmail
* **Shield Attunement**: *+X Enhancement to Shield*
    * Armor attunement is lower when a shield is equipped
* **Weapon Attunement**: *+X Enhancement to Weapon*
    * +1 Greataxe, Amulet of Mighty Fists +1
* **Off-Hand Attunement**: *+X Enhancement to Off-Hand Weapon/Secondary Natural Attacks*
    * Weapon attunement is lower when dual wielding or using secondary natural attacks
* **Resistance**: *+X Resistance to Saving Throws*
    * Cloak of Resistance +1
* **Deflection**: *+X Deflection to AC*
    * Ring of Deflection +1
* **Toughness**: *+X Enhancement to Natural Armor*
    * e.g. Amulet of Natural Armor +1
* **Mental Prowess**: *+X Enhancement to Mental Ability Score*
    * Headband of Wisdom +2
* **Physical Prowess**: *+X Enhancement to Physical Ability Score*
    * Belt of Strength +2

Mental Prowess and Physical Prowess allow you to select which ability scores to boost. The bonuses you receive are further customizable using Legendary Gifts, detailed below.

![Legendary gifts screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/blob/main/screenshots/legendary_gifts.png)

Each Legendary Gift allows you to select a different special bonus. In addition to the Legendary Gifts you receive at level 19 and 20, you receive 2 Legendary Gifts at every Mythic Level for a total of 28. If you are on the Legend path, you receive an additional Legendary Gift at level 22 and every two levels after.

### Legendary Ability

Gain a +1 inherent bonus to any ability score. You can select this legendary gift multiple times, and it stacks up to +5 in any one ability score.

### Legendary Prowess

This allows you to increase the bonuses granted by Physical Prowess or Mental Prowess. You cannot increase the bonus to any single ability score above +6.

### Legendary Shieldmaster

Removes the armor enhancement bonus penalty applied when using a shield.

### Legendary Twin Weapons

Removes the weapon enhancement bonus penalty applied when using off-hand or secondary weapons.

### Legendary Enchantments

![Attunement screenshot](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/AutomaticBonusProgression/blob/main/screenshots/attunement.png)

Allows you to apply enchantments to your equipment (Armor, Shield, Weapon, Off-Hand). Each enchantment has an Enhancement Cost and you can apply enchantments with a total cost equal to your rank in the corresponding feature (max 5).
